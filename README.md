# PGP Strings Decrypter

Easily decrypt PGP-encrypted strings right inside a static web page. 

Clone this repository to your local machine (or download the 
[archive](https://github.com/gdelhumeau/pgp-decrypter/archive/refs/tags/version-1.0.zip)) and decrypt any PGP-encrypted 
text directly in your browser—securely, in memory, and without transmitting any data over the Internet.

It’s useful for me; maybe it’ll be useful for you too.
